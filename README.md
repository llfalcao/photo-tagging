# Photo Tagging App

The idea of this project is similar to the "Where's Wally?" book series, where you try to find the main character in a crowd. Here, the user has to find five characters, and at the end of the game they're given the option to save their nickname and time spent playing, which are then added to a leaderboard on the site.

[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) was used as Backend as a Service, while [React](https://reactjs.org/) was used on the frontend.

This is now the second to last project on [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)'s JS curriculum. More backend later!
